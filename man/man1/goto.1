.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
If command extensions are enabled (the default), and you use the
\f[B]goto\f[R] command with a target label of \f[B]:EOF\f[R], you
transfer control to the end of the current batch script file and exit
the batch script file without defining a label.
When you use this command with the \f[B]:EOF\f[R] label, you must insert
a colon before the label.
For example: \f[C]goto:EOF\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
You can use spaces in the \f[I]label\f[R] parameter, but you can\[cq]t
include other separators (for example, semicolons (;) or equal signs
(=)).
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[I]label\f[R] value that you specify must match a label in the
batch program.
The label within the batch program must begin with a colon (:).
If a line begins with a colon, it\[cq]s treated as a label and any
commands on that line are ignored.
If your batch program doesn\[cq]t contain the label that you specify in
the \f[I]label\f[R] parameter, then the batch program stops and displays
the following message: \f[C]Label not found\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
You can use \f[B]goto\f[R] with other commands to perform conditional
operations.
For more information about using \f[B]goto\f[R] for conditional
operations, see the if command.
.SS Examples
.PP
The following batch program formats a disk in drive A as a system disk.
If the operation is successful, the \f[B]goto\f[R] command directs
processing to the \f[B]:end\f[R] label:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
echo off
format a: /s
if not errorlevel 1 goto end
echo An error occurred during formatting.
:end
echo End of batch program.
\f[R]
.fi
