on demand, and displays and changes scheduled tasks.

[!NOTE] The \f[B]schtasks.exe\f[R] tool performs the same operations as
\f[B]Scheduled Tasks\f[R] in \f[B]Control Panel\f[R].
You can use these tools together and interchangeably.
.RE
.SS Required permissions
.IP \[bu] 2
To schedule, view, and change all tasks on the local computer, you must
be a member of the Administrators group.
.IP \[bu] 2
To schedule, view, and change all tasks on the remote computer, you must
be a member of the Administrators group on the remote computer, or you
must use the \f[B]/u\f[R] parameter to provide the credentials of an
Administrator of the remote computer.
.IP \[bu] 2
You can use the \f[B]/u\f[R] parameter in a \f[B]/create\f[R] or
\f[B]/change\f[R] operation if the local and remote computers are in the
same domain, or if the local computer is in a domain that the remote
computer domain trusts.
Otherwise, the remote computer can\[cq]t authenticate the user account
specified, and it can\[cq]t verify that the account is a member of the
Administrators group.
.IP \[bu] 2
The task you plan to run must have the appropriate permission; these
permissions vary by task.
By default, tasks run with the permissions of the current user of the
local computer, or with the permissions of the user specified by the
\f[B]/u\f[R] parameter, if one is included.
To run a task with permissions of a different user account or with
system permissions, use the \f[B]/ru\f[R] parameter.
