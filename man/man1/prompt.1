.PP
Changes the Cmd.exe command prompt, including displaying any text you
want, such as the name of the current directory, the time and date, or
the Microsoft Windows version number.
If used without parameters, this command resets the command prompt to
the default setting, which is the current drive letter and directory
followed by the greater than symbol (\f[B]>\f[R]).

If you include the \f[B]$p\f[R] character in the text parameter, your
disk is read after you enter each command (to determine the current
drive and path).
This can take extra time, especially for floppy disk drives.
.SS Examples
