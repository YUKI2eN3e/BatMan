.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]rem\f[R] command doesn\[cq]t display comments on the screen.
To display comments on the screen, you must include the \f[B]echo
on\f[R] command in your file.
.IP \[bu] 2
You can\[cq]t use a redirection character (\f[C]<\f[R] or \f[C]>\f[R])
or pipe (\f[C]|\f[R]) in a batch file comment.
.IP \[bu] 2
Although you can use \f[B]rem\f[R] without a comment to add vertical
spacing to a batch file, you can also use blank lines.
Blank lines are ignored when a batch program is processed.
.SS Examples

.IP

.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rem The commands in this script set up 3 drives.
rem The first drive is a primary partition and is
rem assigned the letter D. The second and third drives
rem are logical partitions, and are assigned letters
rem E and F.
create partition primary size=2048
assign d:
create partition extended
create partition logical size=2048
assign e:
create partition logical
assign f:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
For multi-line comments, use conditional execution:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
  Rem/||(
    The REM statement evaluates to success,
    so these lines will never be executed.
    Keep in mind that you will need to escape closing parentheses
    within multi-line comment blocks like shown in this example. \[ha])
