Description
T}
_
T{
/s
T}@T{
Copies subdirectories.
This option automatically excludes empty directories.
T}
T{
/e
T}@T{
Copies subdirectories.
This option automatically includes empty directories.
T}
T{
/lev:\f[C]<n>\f[R]
T}@T{
Copies only the top \f[I]n\f[R] levels of the source directory tree.
T}
T{
/z
T}@T{
Copies files in restartable mode.
In restartable mode, should a file copy be interrupted, Robocopy can
pick up where it left off rather than re-copying the entire file.
T}
T{
/b
T}@T{
Copies files in backup mode.
Backup mode allows Robocopy to override file and folder permission
settings (ACLs).
This allows you to copy files you might otherwise not have access to,
assuming it\[cq]s being run under an account with sufficient privileges.
T}
T{
/zb
T}@T{
Copies files in restartable mode.
If file access is denied, switches to backup mode.
T}
T{
/j
T}@T{
Copies using unbuffered I/O (recommended for large files).
T}
T{
/efsraw
T}@T{
Copies all encrypted files in EFS RAW mode.
T}
T{
/copy:\f[C]<copyflags>\f[R]

directory, allows the destination directory security settings to not be
overwritten.
T}
T{
/mir
T}@T{
Mirrors a directory tree (equivalent to \f[B]/e\f[R] plus
\f[B]/purge\f[R]).
Using this option with the \f[B]/e\f[R] option and a destination

\f[I]n\f[R] must be an integer between 1 and 128.
The default value for \f[I]n\f[R] is 8.
For better performance, redirect your output using \f[B]/log\f[R]
option.
