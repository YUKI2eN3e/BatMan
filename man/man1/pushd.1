.PP
Stores the current directory for use by the \f[B]popd\f[R] command, and
then changes to the specified directory.
.PP
Every time you use the \f[B]pushd\f[R] command, a single directory is
stored for your use.
However, you can store multiple directories by using the \f[B]pushd\f[R]
command multiple times.
The directories are stored sequentially in a virtual stack, so if you
use the \f[B]pushd\f[R] command once, the directory in which you use the
command is placed at the bottom of the stack.
If you use the command again, the second directory is placed on top of
the first one.
The process repeats every time you use the \f[B]pushd\f[R] command.
.PP
If you use the \f[B]popd\f[R] command, the directory on the top of the
stack is removed and the current directory is changed to that directory.
If you use the \f[B]popd\f[R] command again, the next directory on the
stack is removed.
If command extensions are enabled, the \f[B]popd\f[R] command removes
any drive-letter assignment created by the \f[B]pushd\f[R] command.

.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
If command extensions are enabled, the \f[B]pushd\f[R] command accepts
either a network path or a local drive letter and path.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you specify a network path, the \f[B]pushd\f[R] command temporarily
assigns the highest unused drive letter (starting with Z:) to the
specified network resource.
The command then changes the current drive and directory to the
specified directory on the newly assigned drive.
If you use the \f[B]popd\f[R] command with command extensions enabled,
the \f[B]popd\f[R] command removes the drive-letter assignment created
by \f[B]pushd\f[R].
