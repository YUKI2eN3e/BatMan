Displays or alters the compression of files or directories on NTFS
partitions.
If used without parameters, \f[B]compact\f[R] displays the compression
state of the current directory and any files it contains.

Parameter
T}@T{
Description
T}
_
T{
/c
T}@T{
Compresses the specified directory or file.
Directories are marked so any files added afterwards are compressed,
unless the /EXE parameter is specified.
T}
T{
/u
T}@T{
Uncompresses the specified directory or file.
Directories are marked so any files added afterwards aren\[cq]t
compressed.
If the /EXE parameter is specified, only files compressed as executables
are uncompressed; if you don\[cq]t specify the /EXE parameter, only NTFS
compressed files are uncompressed.
T}
T{
/s\f[C][:<dir>]\f[R]
T}@T{
Performs the chosen operation on files in the specified directory and
all subdirectories.
By default, the current directory is used as the \f[C]<dir>\f[R] value.
T}
T{
/a
T}@T{
Displays hidden or system files.
By default, these files aren\[cq]t included.
T}
T{
/i
T}@T{
Continues performing the specified operation, ignoring errors.
By default, this command stops when an error is encountered.
T}
T{
/f
T}@T{
Forces compression or uncompression of the specified directory or file.
Already-compressed files are skipped by default.
The \f[B]/f\f[R] parameter is used in the case of a file that was partly
compressed when the operation was interrupted by a system crash.
To force the file to be compressed in its entirety, use the \f[B]/c\f[R]
and \f[B]/f\f[R] parameters and specify the partially compressed file.
T}
T{
/q
T}@T{
Reports only the most essential information.
T}
T{
/EXE
T}@T{
Uses compression optimized for executable files that are read
frequently, but not modified.
Supported algorithms are:
T}
T{
/CompactOs
T}@T{
Sets or queries the system\[cq]s compression state.
Supported options are:
T}
T{
/windir
T}@T{
Used with the \f[B]/CompactOs:query\f[R] parameter, when querying the
offline operating system.
Specifies the directory where Windows is installed.
T}
T{
\f[C]<filename>\f[R]
T}@T{
Specifies a pattern, file, or directory.
You can use multiple file names, and the \f[B]*\f[R] and \f[B]?\f[R]
wildcard characters.
T}
T{
/?
T}@T{
Displays help at the command prompt.

.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
This command is the command-line version of the NTFS file system
compression feature.
The compression state of a directory indicates whether files are
automatically compressed when they are added to the directory.
Setting the compression state of a directory does not necessarily change
the compression state of files that are already in the directory.
.IP \[bu] 2
You can\[cq]t use this command to read, write, or mount volumes
compressed using DriveSpace or DoubleSpace.
You also can\[cq]t use this command to compress file allocation table
(FAT) or FAT32 partitions.
.SS Examples
.PP
To set the compression state of the current directory, its
subdirectories, and existing files, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
compact /c /s
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To set the compression state of files and subdirectories within the
current directory, without altering the compression state of the current
directory itself, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
compact /c /s *.*
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To compress a volume, from the root directory of the volume, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
compact /c /i /s:\[rs]
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
[!NOTE] This example sets the compression state of all directories
(including the root directory on the volume) and compresses every file
on the volume.
The \f[B]/i\f[R] parameter prevents error messages from interrupting the
compression process.
.RE
.PP
To compress all files with the .bmp file name extension in the directory
and all subdirectories of , without modifying the compressed attribute
of the directories, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
compact /c /s:\[rs]tmp *.bmp
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To force complete compression of the file \f[I]zebra.bmp\f[R], which was
partially compressed during a system crash, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
compact /c /f zebra.bmp
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To remove the compressed attribute from the directory c:, without
changing the compression state of any files in that directory, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
compact /u c:\[rs]tmp
\f[R]
.fi
