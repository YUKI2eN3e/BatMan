.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
You can\[cq]t delete a directory that contains files, including hidden
or system files.
If you attempt to do so, the following message appears:
.RS 2
.PP
\f[C]The directory is not empty\f[R]
.PP
Use the \f[B]dir /a\f[R] command to list all files (including hidden and
system files).
Then use the \f[B]attrib\f[R] command with \f[B]-h\f[R] to remove hidden
file attributes, \f[B]-s\f[R] to remove system file attributes, or
\f[B]-h -s\f[R] to remove both hidden and system file attributes.
After the hidden and file attributes have been removed, you can delete
the files.
