T{
/i
T}@T{
Displays the \f[B]Remote Shutdown\f[R] box.
The \f[B]/i\f[R] option must be the first parameter following the
command.
If \f[B]/i\f[R] is specified, all other options are ignored.
T}
T{
/l
T}@T{
Logs off the current user immediately, with no time-out period.
You cannot use \f[B]/l\f[R] with \f[B]/m\f[R] or \f[B]/t\f[R].
T}
T{
/s
T}@T{
Shuts down the computer.
T}
T{
/sg
T}@T{
Shuts down the computer.
On the next boot, if \f[B]Automatic Restart Sign-On\f[R] is enabled, the
device automatically signs in and locks based on the last interactive
user.
After sign in, it restarts any registered applications.
T}
T{
/r
T}@T{
Restarts the computer after shutdown.
T}
T{
/g
T}@T{
Shuts down the computer.
On the next restart, if \f[B]Automatic Restart Sign-On\f[R] is enabled,
the device automatically signs in and locks based on the last
interactive user.
After sign in, it restarts any registered applications.
T}
T{
/a
T}@T{
Aborts a system shutdown.
Effective only during the time-out period.
To use \f[B]/a\f[R], you must also use the \f[B]/m\f[R] option.
T}
T{
/p
T}@T{
Turns off the local computer only (not a remote computer)\[em]with no
time-out period or warning.
You can use \f[B]/p\f[R] only with \f[B]/d\f[R] or \f[B]/f\f[R].
If your computer doesn\[cq]t support power-off functionality, it will
shut down when you use \f[B]/p\f[R], but the power to the computer will
remain on.
T}
T{
/h
T}@T{
Puts the local computer into hibernation, if hibernation is enabled.
You can use \f[B]/h\f[R] only with \f[B]/f\f[R].
T}
T{
hybrid
T}@T{
Shuts down the device and prepares it for fast startup.
This option must be used with the \f[B]/s\f[R] option.
T}
T{
/fw
T}@T{
Combining this option with a shutdown option causes the next restart to
go to the firmware user interface.
T}
T{
/e
T}@T{
Enables you to document the reason for the unexpected shutdown on the
target computer.
T}
T{
/o
T}@T{
Goes to the \f[B]Advanced boot options\f[R] menu and restarts the
device.
This option must be used with the \f[B]/r\f[R] option.
T}
T{
/f
T}@T{
Forces running applications to close without warning
users.\f[B]Caution:\f[R] Using the \f[B]/f\f[R] option might result in
loss of unsaved data.

/m \f[C]\[rs]\[rs]<computername>\f[R]
T}@T{
Specifies the target computer.
Can\[cq]t be used with the \f[B]/l\f[R] option.
T}
T{
/t \f[C]<xxx>\f[R]
T}@T{
Sets the time-out period before shutdown to \f[I]xxx\f[R] seconds.
The valid range is 0-315360000 (10 years), with a default of 30.
If the timeout period is greater than 0, the \f[B]/f\f[R] parameter is
implied.
T}
T{
/d \f[C][p | u:]<XX>:<YY>\f[R]
T}@T{
Lists the reason for the system restart or shutdown.
The supported parameter values are:
T}
T{
/c \f[C]<comment>\f[R]
T}@T{
Enables you to comment in detail about the reason for the shutdown.
You must first provide a reason by using the \f[B]/d\f[R] option and you
must enclose your comments in quotation marks.
You can use a maximum of 511 characters.
T}
T{
/?

.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
Users must be assigned the \f[B]Shut down the system\f[R] user right to
shut down a local or remotely administered computer that is using the
\f[B]shutdown\f[R] command.
.IP \[bu] 2
Users must be members of the \f[B]Administrators\f[R] group to annotate
an unexpected shutdown of a local or remotely administered computer.
If the target computer is joined to a domain, members of the \f[B]Domain
Admins\f[R] group might be able to perform this procedure.
For more information, see:

.IP \[bu] 2
If you want to shut down more than one computer at a time, you can call
\f[B]shutdown\f[R] for each computer by using a script, or you can use
\f[B]shutdown\f[R] \f[B]/i\f[R] to display the \f[B]Remote Shutdown\f[R]
box.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you specify major and minor reason codes, you must first define these
reason codes on each computer where you plan to use the reasons.
If the reason codes aren\[cq]t defined on the target computer, Shutdown
Event Tracker can\[cq]t log the correct reason text.
.IP \[bu] 2
Remember to indicate that a shutdown is planned by using the \f[B]p\f[R]
parameter.
Not using the \f[B]p\f[R] parameter, indicates that the shutdown was
unplanned.
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Using the \f[B]p\f[R] parameter, along the reason code for an unplanned
shutdown, causes the shutdown to fail.
.IP \[bu] 2
Not using the \f[B]p\f[R] parameter, and only providing the reason code
for an planned shutdown, also causes the shutdown to fail
