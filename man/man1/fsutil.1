Subcommand
T}@T{
Description
T}
_
T{
fsutil 8dot3name
T}@T{
Queries or changes the settings for short name behavior on the system,
for example, generates 8.3 character-length file names.
Removes short names for all files within a directory.
Scans a directory and identifies registry keys that might be impacted if
short names were stripped from the files in the directory.
T}
T{
fsutil dirty
T}@T{
Queries whether the volume\[cq]s dirty bit is set or sets a volume\[cq]s
dirty bit.
When a volume\[cq]s dirty bit is set, \f[B]autochk\f[R] automatically
checks the volume for errors the next time the computer is restarted.
T}
T{
fsutil file
T}@T{
Finds a file by user name (if Disk Quotas are enabled), queries
allocated ranges for a file, sets a file\[cq]s short name, sets a
file\[cq]s valid data length, sets zero data for a file, creates a new
file of a specified size, finds a file ID if given the name, or finds a
file link name for a specified file ID.
T}
T{
fsutil fsinfo
T}@T{
Lists all drives and queries the drive type, volume information,
NTFS-specific volume information, or file system statistics.
T}
T{
fsutil hardlink
T}@T{
Lists hard links for a file, or creates a hard link (a directory entry
for a file).
Every file can be considered to have at least one hard link.
On NTFS volumes, each file can have multiple hard links, so a single
file can appear in many directories (or even in the same directory, with
different names).
Because all of the links reference the same file, programs can open any
of the links and modify the file.
A file is deleted from the file system only after all links to it are
deleted.
After you create a hard link, programs can use it like any other file
name.
T}
T{
fsutil objectid
T}@T{
Manages object identifiers, which are used by the Windows operating
system to track objects such as files and directories.
T}
T{
fsutil quota
T}@T{
Manages disk quotas on NTFS volumes to provide more precise control of
network-based storage.
Disk quotas are implemented on a per-volume basis and enable both hard-
and soft-storage limits to be implemented on a per-user basis.
T}
T{
fsutil repair
T}@T{
Queries or sets the self-healing state of the volume.
Self-healing NTFS attempts to correct corruptions of the NTFS file
system online without requiring \f[B]Chkdsk.exe\f[R] to be run.
Includes initiating on-disk verification and waiting for repair
completion.
T}
T{
fsutil reparsepoint
T}@T{
Queries or deletes reparse points (NTFS file system objects that have a
definable attribute containing user-controlled data).
Reparse points are used to extend functionality in the input/output
(I/O) subsystem.
They are used for directory junction points and volume mount points.
They are also used by file system filter drivers to mark certain files
as special to that driver.
T}
T{
fsutil resource
T}@T{
Creates a Secondary Transactional Resource Manager, starts or stops a
Transactional Resource Manager, displays information about a
Transactional Resource Manager or modifies its behavior.
T}
T{
fsutil sparse
T}@T{
Manages sparse files.
A sparse file is a file with one or more regions of unallocated data in
it.
A program will see these unallocated regions as containing bytes with
the value zero, but no disk space is used to represent these zeros.
All meaningful or nonzero data is allocated, whereas all non-meaningful
data (large strings of data composed of zeros) is not allocated.
When a sparse file is read, allocated data is returned as stored and
unallocated data is returned as zeros (by default in accordance with the
C2 security requirement specification).
Sparse file support allows data to be deallocated from anywhere in the
file.
T}
T{
fsutil tiering
T}@T{
Enables management of storage tier functions, such as setting and
disabling flags and listing of tiers.
T}
T{
fsutil transaction
T}@T{
Commits a specified transaction, rolls back a specified transaction, or
displays info about the transaction.
T}
T{
fsutil usn
T}@T{
Manages the update sequence number (USN) change journal, which provides
a persistent log of all changes made to files on the volume.
T}
T{
fsutil volume
T}@T{
Manages a volume.
Dismounts a volume, queries to see how much free space is available on a
disk, or finds a file that is using a specified cluster.
T}
T{
fsutil wim
T}@T{
Provides functions to discover and manage WIM-backed files.
