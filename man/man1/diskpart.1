The diskpart command interpreter helps you manage your computer\[cq]s
drives (disks, partitions, volumes, or virtual hard disks).
.PP
Before you can use \f[B]diskpart\f[R] commands, you must first list, and
then select an object to give it focus.
After an object has focus, any diskpart commands that you type will act
on that object.
.SS List available objects
.PP
You can list the available objects and determine an object\[cq]s number
or drive letter by using:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]list disk\f[R] - Displays all the disks on the computer.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]list volume\f[R] - Displays all the volumes on the computer.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]list partition\f[R] - Displays the partitions on the disk that has
focus on the computer.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]list vdisk\f[R] - Displays all the virtual disks on the computer.
.PP
After you run the \f[B]list\f[R] commands, an asterisk (*) appears next
to the object with focus.
.SS Determine focus
.PP
When you select an object, the focus remains on that object until you
select a different object.
For example, if the focus is set on disk 0 and you select volume 8 on
disk 2, the focus shifts from disk 0 to disk 2, volume 8.
.PP
Some commands automatically change the focus.
For example, when you create a new partition, the focus automatically
switches to the new partition.
.PP
You can only give focus to a partition on the selected disk.
After a partition has focus, the related volume (if any) also has focus.
After a volume has focus, the related disk and partition also have focus
if the volume maps to a single specific partition.
If this isn\[cq]t the case, focus on the disk and partition is lost.
.SS Syntax
.PP
To start the diskpart command interpreter, at the command prompt type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
diskpart <parameter>
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
[!IMPORTANT] You must be in your local \f[B]Administrators\f[R] group,
or a group with similar permissions, to run diskpart.
