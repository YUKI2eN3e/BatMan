.PP
Displays a list of a directory\[cq]s files and subdirectories.
If used without parameters, this command displays the disk\[cq]s volume
label and serial number, followed by a list of directories and files on
the disk (including their names and the date and time each was last
modified).
For files, this command displays the name extension and the size in
bytes.
This command also displays the total number of files and directories
listed, their cumulative size, and the free space (in bytes) remaining
on the disk.
.PP
The \f[B]dir\f[R] command can also run from the Windows Recovery
Console, using different parameters.
For more information, see Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).

.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
To use multiple \f[I]filename\f[R] parameters, separate each file name
with a space, comma, or semicolon.
.IP \[bu] 2
You can use wildcard characters (\f[B]*\f[R] or \f[B]?\f[R]), to
represent one or more characters of a file name and to display a subset
of files or subdirectories.
.IP \[bu] 2
You can use the wildcard character, \f[B]*\f[R], to substitute for any
string of characters, for example:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]dir *.txt\f[R] lists all files in the current directory with
extensions that begin with .txt, such as .txt, .txt1, .txt_old.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]dir read *.txt\f[R] lists all files in the current directory that
begin with read and with extensions that begin with .txt, such as .txt,
\&.txt1, or .txt_old.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]dir read *.*\f[R] lists all files in the current directory that
begin with read with any extension.
.PP
The asterisk wildcard always uses short file name mapping, so you might
get unexpected results.
For example, the following directory contains two files (t.txt2 and
t97.txt):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
C:\[rs]test>dir /x
Volume in drive C has no label.
Volume Serial Number is B86A-EF32

Directory of C:\[rs]test

11/30/2004  01:40 PM <DIR>  .
11/30/2004  01:40 PM <DIR> ..
11/30/2004  11:05 AM 0 T97B4\[ti]1.TXT t.txt2
11/30/2004  01:16 PM 0 t97.txt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You might expect that typing \f[C]dir t97\[rs]*\f[R] would return the
file t97.txt.
However, typing \f[C]dir t97\[rs]*\f[R] returns both files, because the
asterisk wildcard matches the file t.txt2 to t97.txt by using its short
name map \f[I]T97B4\[ti]1.TXT\f[R].
Similarly, typing \f[C]del t97\[rs]*\f[R] would delete both files.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
You can use the question mark (?)
as a substitute for a single character in a name.
For example, typing \f[C]dir read???.txt\f[R] lists any files in the
current directory with the .txt extension that begin with read and are
followed by up to three characters.
This includes Read.txt, Read1.txt, Read12.txt, Read123.txt, and
Readme1.txt, but not Readme12.txt.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you use \f[B]/a\f[R] with more than one value in
\f[I]attributes\f[R], this command displays the names of only those
files with all the specified attributes.
For example, if you use \f[B]/a\f[R] with \f[B]r\f[R] and \f[B]-h\f[R]
as attributes (by using either \f[C]/a:r-h\f[R] or \f[C]/ar-h\f[R]),
this command will only display the names of the read-only files that
aren\[cq]t hidden.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you specify more than one \f[I]sortorder\f[R] value, this command
sorts the file names by the first criterion, then by the second
criterion, and so on.
For example, if you use \f[B]/o\f[R] with the \f[B]e\f[R] and
\f[B]-s\f[R] parameters for \f[I]sortorder\f[R] (by using either
\f[C]/o:e-s\f[R] or \f[C]/oe-s\f[R]), this command sorts the names of
directories and files by extension, with the largest first, and then
displays the final result.
The alphabetic sorting by extension causes file names with no extensions
to appear first, then directory names, and then file names with
extensions.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you use the redirection symbol (\f[C]>\f[R]) to send this
command\[cq]s output to a file, or if you use a pipe (\f[C]|\f[R]) to
send this command\[cq]s output to another command, you must use
\f[C]/a:-d\f[R] and \f[B]/b\f[R] to only list the file names.
You can use \f[I]filename\f[R] with \f[B]/b\f[R] and \f[B]/s\f[R] to
specify that this command is to search the current directory and its
subdirectories for all file names that match \f[I]filename\f[R].
This command lists only the drive letter, directory name, file name, and
file name extension (one path per line), for each file name it finds.
Before you use a pipe to send this command\[cq]s output to another
command, you should set the \f[I]TEMP\f[R] environment variable in your
Autoexec.nt file.
.SS Examples
.PP
To display all directories one after the other, in alphabetical order,
in wide format, and pausing after each screen, make sure that the root
directory is the current directory, and then type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dir /s/w/o/p
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The output lists the root directory, the subdirectories, and the files
in the root directory, including extensions.
This command also lists the subdirectory names and the file names in
each subdirectory in the tree.
.PP
To alter the preceding example so that \f[B]dir\f[R] displays the file
names and extensions, but omits the directory names, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dir /s/w/o/p/a:-d
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To print a directory listing, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dir > prn
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When you specify \f[B]prn\f[R], the directory list is sent to the
printer that is attached to the LPT1 port.
If your printer is attached to a different port, you must replace
\f[B]prn\f[R] with the name of the correct port.
.PP
You can also redirect output of the \f[B]dir\f[R] command to a file by
replacing \f[B]prn\f[R] with a file name.
You can also type a path.
For example, to direct \f[B]dir\f[R] output to the file dir.doc in the
Records directory, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dir > \[rs]records\[rs]dir.doc
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If dir.doc does not exist, \f[B]dir\f[R] creates it, unless the
\f[B]Records\f[R] directory does not exist.
In that case, the following message appears:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
File creation error
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To display a list of all the file names with the .txt extension in all
directories on drive C, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dir c:\[rs]*.txt /w/o/s/p
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The \f[B]dir\f[R] command displays, in wide format, an alphabetized list
of the matching file names in each directory, and it pauses each time
the screen fills until you press any key to continue.
