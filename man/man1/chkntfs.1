Description
T}
_
T{
\f[C]<volume>\f[R] [\&...]
T}@T{
Specifies one or more volumes to check when the computer starts.
Valid volumes include drive letters (followed by a colon), mount points,
or volume names.
T}
T{
/d
T}@T{
Restores all \f[B]chkntfs\f[R] default settings, except the countdown
time for automatic file checking.
By default, all volumes are checked when the computer is started, and
\f[B]chkdsk\f[R] runs on those that are dirty.
T}
T{
/t [\f[C]:<time>\f[R]]
T}@T{
Changes the Autochk.exe initiation countdown time to the amount of time
specified in seconds.
If you do not enter a time, \f[B]/t\f[R] displays the current countdown
time.
T}
T{
/x \f[C]<volume>\f[R] [\&...]
T}@T{
Specifies one or more volumes to exclude from checking when the computer
is started, even if the volume is marked as requiring \f[B]chkdsk\f[R].
T}
T{
/c \f[C]<volume>\f[R] [\&...]
T}@T{
Schedules one or more volumes to be checked when the computer is
started, and runs \f[B]chkdsk\f[R] on those that are dirty.

.SS Examples
.PP
To display the type of file system for drive C, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
chkntfs c:
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
[!NOTE] If automatic file checking is scheduled to run, additional
output will display, indicating whether the drive is dirty or has been
manually scheduled to be checked the next time the computer is started.
.RE
.PP
To display the Autochk.exe initiation countdown time, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
chkntfs /t
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To change the Autochk.exe initiation countdown time to 30 seconds, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
chkntfs /t:30
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
[!NOTE] Although you can set the Autochk.exe initiation countdown time
to zero, doing so will prevent you from canceling a potentially
time-consuming automatic file check.
.RE
.PP
To exclude multiple volumes from being checked, you must list each of
them in a single command.
For example, to exclude both the D and E volumes, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
chkntfs /x d: e:
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
[!IMPORTANT] The \f[B]/x\f[R] command-line option isn\[cq]t
accumulative.
If you type it more than once, the most recent entry overrides the
previous entry.
.RE
.PP
To schedule automatic file checking on the D volume, but not the C or E
volumes, type the following commands in order:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
chkntfs /d
chkntfs /x c: d: e:
chkntfs /c d:
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
[!IMPORTANT] The \f[B]/c\f[R] command-line option is accumulative.
If you type \f[B]/c\f[R] more than once, each entry remains.
To ensure that only a particular volume is checked, reset the defaults
to clear all previous commands, exclude all volumes from being checked,
and then schedule automatic file checking on the desired volume.
