them.

Description
T}
_
T{
/a
T}@T{
Abbreviates the output of an ASCII comparison.
Instead of displaying all of the lines that are different, \f[B]fc\f[R]
displays only the first and last line for each set of differences.
T}
T{
/b
T}@T{
Compares the two files in binary mode, byte by byte, and does not
attempt to resynchronize the files after finding a mismatch.
This is the default mode for comparing files that have the following
file extensions: .exe, .com, .sys, .obj, .lib, or .bin.
T}
T{
/c
T}@T{
Ignores the letter case.
T}
T{
/l
T}@T{
Compares the files in ASCII mode, line-by-line, and attempts to
resynchronize the files after finding a mismatch.
This is the default mode for comparing files, except files with the
following file extensions: .exe, .com, .sys, .obj, .lib, or .bin.
T}
T{
/lb\f[C]<n>\f[R]
T}@T{
Sets the number of lines for the internal line buffer to \f[I]N\f[R].
The default length of the line buffer is 100 lines.
If the files that you are comparing have more than 100 consecutive
differing lines, \f[B]fc\f[R] cancels the comparison.
T}
T{
/n
T}@T{
Displays the line numbers during an ASCII comparison.
T}
T{
/off[line]
T}@T{
Doesn\[cq]t skip files that have the offline attribute set.
T}
T{
/t
T}@T{
Prevents \f[B]fc\f[R] from converting tabs to spaces.
The default behavior is to treat tabs as spaces, with stops at each
eighth character position.
T}
T{
/u
T}@T{
Compares files as Unicode text files.
T}
T{
/w
T}@T{
Compresses white space (that is, tabs and spaces) during the comparison.
If a line contains many consecutive spaces or tabs, \f[B]/w\f[R] treats
these characters as a single space.
When used with \f[B]/w\f[R], \f[B]fc\f[R] ignores white space at the
beginning and end of a line.
T}
T{
/\f[C]<nnnn>\f[R]
T}@T{
Specifies the number of consecutive lines that must match following a
mismatch, before \f[B]fc\f[R] considers the files to be resynchronized.
If the number of matching lines in the files is less than
\f[I]nnnn\f[R], \f[B]fc\f[R] displays the matching lines as differences.
The default value is 2.
T}
T{
\f[C][<drive1>:][<path1>]<filename1>\f[R]
T}@T{
Specifies the location and name of the first file or set of files to
compare.
\f[I]filename1\f[R] is required.
T}
T{
\f[C][<drive2>:][<path2>]<filename2>\f[R]
T}@T{
Specifies the location and name of the second file or set of files to
compare.
\f[I]filename2\f[R] is required.
T}
T{
/?
T}@T{
Displays help at the command prompt.

.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
This command is implemeted by c:.exe.
You can use this command within PowerShell, but be sure to spell out the
full executable (fc.exe) since `fc' is also an alias for Format-Custom.
.IP \[bu] 2
When you use \f[B]fc\f[R] for an ASCII comparison, \f[B]fc\f[R] displays
the differences between two files in the following order:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Name of the first file
.IP \[bu] 2
Lines from \f[I]filename1\f[R] that differ between the files
.IP \[bu] 2
First line to match in both files
.IP \[bu] 2
Name of the second file
.IP \[bu] 2
Lines from \f[I]filename2\f[R] that differ
.IP \[bu] 2
First line to match
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]/b\f[R] displays mismatches that are found during a binary
comparison in the following syntax:
.RS 2
.PP
\f[C]\[rs]<XXXXXXXX: YY ZZ>\f[R]
.PP
The value of \f[I]XXXXXXXX\f[R] specifies the relative hexadecimal
address for the pair of bytes, measured from the beginning of the file.
Addresses start at 00000000.
The hexadecimal values for \f[I]YY\f[R] and \f[I]ZZ\f[R] represent the
mismatched bytes from \f[I]filename1\f[R] and \f[I]filename2\f[R],
respectively.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
You can use wildcard characters (\f[B]*\f[R] and \f[B]?\f[R]) in
\f[I]filename1\f[R] and \f[I]filename2\f[R].
If you use a wildcard in \f[I]filename1\f[R], \f[B]fc\f[R] compares all
the specified files to the file or set of files specified by
\f[I]filename2\f[R].
If you use a wildcard in \f[I]filename2\f[R], \f[B]fc\f[R] uses the
corresponding value from \f[I]filename1\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
When comparing ASCII files, \f[B]fc\f[R] uses an internal buffer (large
enough to hold 100 lines) as storage.
If the files are larger than the buffer, \f[B]fc\f[R] compares what it
can load into the buffer.
If \f[B]fc\f[R] doesn\[cq]t find a match in the loaded portions of the
files, it stops and displays the following message:
.RS 2
.PP
\f[C]Resynch failed. Files are too different.\f[R]
.PP
When comparing binary files that are larger than the available memory,
\f[B]fc\f[R] compares both files completely, overlaying the portions in
memory with the next portions from the disk.
The output is the same as that for files that fit completely in memory.
