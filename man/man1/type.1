.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
If you display a binary file or a file that is created by a program, you
may see strange characters on the screen, including formfeed characters
and escape-sequence symbols.
These characters represent control codes that are used in the binary
file.
In general, avoid using the \f[B]type\f[R] command to display binary
files.
