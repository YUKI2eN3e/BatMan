.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[C]echo <message>\f[R] command is particularly useful when
\f[B]echo\f[R] is turned off.
To display a message that is several lines long without displaying any
commands, you can include several \f[C]echo <message>\f[R] commands
after the \f[B]echo off\f[R] command in your batch program.
.IP \[bu] 2
After \f[B]echo\f[R] is turned off, the command prompt doesn\[cq]t
appear in the Command Prompt window.
To display the command prompt, type \f[B]echo on.\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
If used in a batch file, \f[B]echo on\f[R] and \f[B]echo off\f[R]
don\[cq]t affect the setting at the command prompt.
.IP \[bu] 2
To prevent echoing a particular command in a batch file, insert an
\f[C]\[at]\f[R] sign in front of the command.
To prevent echoing all commands in a batch file, include the \f[B]echo
off\f[R] command at the beginning of the file.
.IP \[bu] 2
To display a pipe (\f[C]|\f[R]) or redirection character (\f[C]<\f[R] or
\f[C]>\f[R]) when you are using \f[B]echo\f[R], use a caret
(\f[C]\[ha]\f[R]) immediately before the pipe or redirection character.
For example, \f[C]\[ha]|\f[R], \f[C]\[ha]>\f[R], or \f[C]\[ha]<\f[R]).
To display a caret, type two carets in succession
(\f[C]\[ha]\[ha]\f[R]).
.SS Examples
.PP
To display the current \f[B]echo\f[R] setting, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
echo
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To echo a blank line on the screen, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
echo.
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
[!NOTE] Don\[cq]t include a space before the period.
Otherwise, the period appears instead of a blank line.
.RE
.PP
To prevent echoing commands at the command prompt, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
echo off
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
[!NOTE] When \f[B]echo\f[R] is turned off, the command prompt
doesn\[cq]t appear in the Command Prompt window.
To display the command prompt again, type \f[B]echo on\f[R].
.RE
.PP
To prevent all commands in a batch file (including the \f[B]echo
off\f[R] command) from displaying on the screen, on the first line of
the batch file type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\[at]echo off
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You can use the \f[B]echo\f[R] command as part of an \f[B]if\f[R]
statement.
For example, to search the current directory for any file with the .rpt
file name extension, and to echo a message if such a file is found,
type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
if exist *.rpt echo The report has arrived.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The following batch file searches the current directory for files with
the .txt file name extension, and displays a message indicating the
results of the search:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\[at]echo off
if not exist *.txt (
echo This directory contains no text files.
) else (
   echo This directory contains the following text files:
   echo.
   dir /b *.txt
   )
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If no .txt files are found when the batch file is run, the following
message displays:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
This directory contains no text files.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If .txt files are found when the batch file is run the following output
displays (for this example, assume the files File1.txt, File2.txt, and
File3.txt exist):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
This directory contains the following text files:
File1.txt
File2.txt
File3.txt
\f[R]
.fi
