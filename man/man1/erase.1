If you disable command extension, the \f[B]/s\f[R] parameter will
display the names of any files that weren\[cq]t found ,instead of
displaying the names of files that are being deleted.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you specify specific folders in the \f[C]<names>\f[R] parameter, all
of the included files will also be deleted.
For example, if you want to delete all of the files in the *folder,
type:
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
erase \[rs]work
\f[R]
.fi
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
You can use wildcards (\f[B]*\f[R] and \f[B]?\f[R]) to delete more than
one file at a time.
However, to avoid deleting files unintentionally, you should use
wildcards cautiously.
For example, if you type the following command:
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
erase *.*
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The \f[B]erase\f[R] command displays the following prompt:
.PP
\f[C]Are you sure (Y/N)?\f[R]
.PP
To delete all of the files in the current directory, press \f[B]Y\f[R]
and then press ENTER.
To cancel the deletion, press \f[B]N\f[R] and then press ENTER.
.RS
.PP
[!NOTE] Before you use wildcard characters with the \f[B]erase\f[R]
command, use the same wildcard characters with the \f[B]dir\f[R] command
to list all the files that will be deleted.
