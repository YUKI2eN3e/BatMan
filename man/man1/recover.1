.SH recover
.PP
Recovers readable information from a bad or defective disk.
This command reads a file, sector-by-sector, and recovers data from the
good sectors.
Data in bad sectors is lost.
Because all data in bad sectors is lost when you recover a file, you
should recover only one file at a time.
.PP
Bad sectors reported by the \f[B]chkdsk\f[R] command were marked as bad
when your disk was prepared for operation.
They pose no danger, and \f[B]recover\f[R] does not affect them.
