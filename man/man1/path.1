T{

The current directory is always searched before the directories
specified in the command path.
T}
T{
;
T}@T{
Separates directories in the command path.
If used without other parameters, \f[B];\f[R] clears the existing
command paths from the PATH environment variable and directs Cmd.exe to
search only in the current directory.
T}
T{
\f[C]%PATH%\f[R]
T}@T{
Appends the command path to the existing set of directories listed in
the PATH environment variable.
If you include this parameter, Cmd.exe replaces it with the command path
values found in the PATH environment variable, eliminating the need to
manually enter these values at the command prompt.

.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
The Windows operating system searches using default file name extensions
in the following order of precedence: .exe, .com, .bat, and .cmd.
Which means if you\[cq]re looking for a batch file named, acct.bat, but
have an app named acct.exe in the same directory, you must include the
\&.bat extension at the command prompt.
.IP \[bu] 2
If two or more files in the command path have the same file name and
extension, this command first searches for the specified file name in
the current directory.
Then, it searches the directories in the command path in the order that
they\[cq]re listed in the PATH environment variable.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you place the \f[B]path\f[R] command in your Autoexec.nt file, the
Windows operating system automatically appends the specified MS-DOS
subsystem search path every time you log on to your computer.
Cmd.exe does not use the Autoexec.nt file.
When started from a shortcut, Cmd.exe inherits the environment variables
set in My Computer/Properties/Advanced/Environment.
