.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]endlocal\f[R] command has no effect outside a script or batch
file.
.IP \[bu] 2
There is an implicit \f[B]endlocal\f[R] command at the end of a batch
file.
.IP \[bu] 2
If command extensions are enabled (command extensions are enabled by
default), the \f[B]endlocal\f[R] command restores the state of command
extensions (that is, enabled or disabled) to what it was before the
corresponding \f[B]setlocal\f[R] command was run.

.SS Examples

You can localize environment variables in a batch file.
For example, the following program starts the \f[I]superapp\f[R] batch
program on the network, directs the output to a file, and displays the
file in Notepad:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\[at]echo off
setlocal
path=g:\[rs]programs\[rs]superapp;%path%
call superapp>c:\[rs]superapp.out
endlocal
start notepad c:\[rs]superapp.out
