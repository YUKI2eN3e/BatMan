.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
You can copy an ASCII text file that uses an end-of-file character
(CTRL+Z) to indicate the end of the file.
.IP \[bu] 2
If \f[B]/a\f[R] precedes or follows a list of files on the command line,
it applies to all files listed until \f[B]copy\f[R] encounters
\f[B]/b\f[R].
In this case, \f[B]/b\f[R] applies to the file preceding \f[B]/b\f[R].
.RS 2
.PP
The effect of \f[B]/a\f[R] depends on its position in the command-line
string: - If \f[B]/a\f[R] follows \f[I]source\f[R], the \f[B]copy\f[R]
command treats the file as an ASCII file and copies data that precedes
the first end-of-file character (CTRL+Z).
- If \f[B]/a\f[R] follows \f[I]destination\f[R], the \f[B]copy\f[R]
command adds an end-of-file character (CTRL+Z) as the last character of
the file.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
If \f[B]/b\f[R] directs the command interpreter to read the number of
bytes specified by the file size in the directory.
\f[B]/b\f[R] is the default value for \f[B]copy\f[R], unless
\f[B]copy\f[R] combines files.
.IP \[bu] 2
If \f[B]/b\f[R] precedes or follows a list of files on the command line,
it applies to all listed files until \f[B]copy\f[R] encounters
\f[B]/a\f[R].
In this case, \f[B]/a\f[R] applies to the file preceding \f[B]/a\f[R].
.RS 2
.PP
The effect of \f[B]/b\f[R] depends on its position in the
command\[en]line string: - If \f[B]/b\f[R] follows \f[I]source\f[R], the
\f[B]copy\f[R] command copies the entire file, including any end-of-file
character (CTRL+Z).
- If \f[B]/b\f[R] follows \f[I]destination\f[R], the \f[B]copy\f[R]
command doesn\[cq]t add an end-of-file character (CTRL+Z).
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
If a write operation cannot be verified, an error message appears.
Although recording errors rarely occur with the \f[B]copy\f[R] command ,
you can use \f[B]/v\f[R] to verify that critical data has been correctly
recorded.
The \f[B]/v\f[R] command-line option also slows down the \f[B]copy\f[R]
command, because each sector recorded on the disk must be checked.
.IP \[bu] 2
If \f[B]/y\f[R] is preset in the \f[B]COPYCMD\f[R] environment variable,
you can override this setting by using \f[B]/-y\f[R] at the command
line.
By default, you are prompted when you replace this setting, unless the
\f[B]copy\f[R] command is executed in a batch script.
.IP \[bu] 2
To append files, specify a single file for \f[I]destination\f[R], but
multiple files for \f[I]source\f[R] (use wildcard characters or
\f[I]file1\f[R]+\f[I]file2\f[R]+\f[I]file3\f[R] format).
.IP \[bu] 2
If the connection is lost during the copy phase (for example, if the
server going offline breaks the connection), you can use \f[B]copy
/z\f[R] to resume after the connection is re-established.
The \f[B]/z\f[R] option also displays the percentage of the copy
operation that is completed for each file.
.IP \[bu] 2
You can substitute a device name for one or more occurrences of
\f[I]source\f[R] or \f[I]destination\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
If \f[I]destination\f[R] is a device (for example, Com1 or Lpt1), the
\f[B]/b\f[R] option copies data to the device in binary mode.
In binary mode, \f[B]copy /b\f[R] copies all characters (including
special characters such as CTRL+C, CTRL+S, CTRL+Z, and ENTER) to the
device, as data.
However, if you omit \f[B]/b\f[R], the data is copied to the device in
ASCII mode.
In ASCII mode, special characters might cause files to combine during
the copying process.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you don\[cq]t specify a destination file, a copy is created with the
same name, modified date, and modified time as the original file.
The new copy is stored in the current directory on the current drive.
If the source file is on the current drive and in the current directory
and you do not specify a different drive or directory for the
destination file, the \f[B]copy\f[R] command stops and displays the
following error message:
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
File cannot be copied onto itself
0 File(s) copied
\f[R]
.fi
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
If you specify more than one file in \f[I]source\f[R], the
\f[B]copy\f[R] command combines them all into a single file using the
file name specified in \f[I]destination\f[R].
The \f[B]copy\f[R] command assumes the combined files are ASCII files
unless you use the \f[B]/b\f[R] option.
.IP \[bu] 2
To copy files that are 0 bytes long, or to copy all of a directory\[cq]s
files and subdirectories, use the xcopy command.
.IP \[bu] 2
To assign the current time and date to a file without modifying the
file, use the following syntax:
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
copy /b <source> +,,
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Where the commas indicate that the \f[I]destination\f[R] parameter has
been intentionally left out.

.SS Examples
.PP
To copy a file called \f[I]memo.doc\f[R] to \f[I]letter.doc\f[R] in the
current drive and ensure that an end-of-file character (CTRL+Z) is at
the end of the copied file, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
copy memo.doc letter.doc /a
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To copy a file named \f[I]robin.typ\f[R] from the current drive and
directory to an existing directory named \f[I]Birds\f[R] that is located
on drive C, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
copy robin.typ c:\[rs]birds
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
[!NOTE] If the \f[I]Birds\f[R] directory doesn\[cq]t exist, the file
\f[I]robin.typ\f[R] is copied into a file named \f[I]Birds\f[R] that is
located in the root directory on the disk in drive C.
.RE
.PP
To combine \f[I]Mar89.rpt\f[R], \f[I]Apr89.rpt\f[R], and
\f[I]May89.rpt\f[R], which are located in the current directory, and
place them in a file named \f[I]Report\f[R] (also in the current
directory), type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
copy mar89.rpt + apr89.rpt + may89.rpt Report
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
[!NOTE] If you combine files, the \f[B]copy\f[R] command marks the
destination file with the current date and time.
If you omit \f[I]destination\f[R], the files are combined and stored
under the name of the first file in the list.
.RE
.PP
To combine all files in \f[I]Report\f[R], when a file named
\f[I]Report\f[R] already exists, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
copy report + mar89.rpt + apr89.rpt + may89.rpt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To combine all files in the current directory that have the .txt file
name extension into a single file named \f[I]Combined.doc\f[R], type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
copy *.txt Combined.doc
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To combine several binary files into one file by using wildcard
characters, include \f[B]/b\f[R].
This prevents Windows from treating CTRL+Z as an end-of-file character.
For example, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
copy /b *.exe Combined.exe
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
[!CAUTION] If you combine binary files, the resulting file might be
unusable due to internal formatting.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Combining each file that has a .txt extension with its corresponding
\&.ref file creates a file with the same file name, but with a .doc
extension.
The \f[B]Copy\f[R] command combines \f[I]file1.txt\f[R] with
\f[I]file1.ref\f[R] to form \f[I]file1.doc\f[R], and then the command
combines \f[I]file2.txt\f[R] with \f[I]file2.ref\f[R] to form
\f[I]file2.doc\f[R], and so on.
For example, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
copy *.txt + *.ref *.doc
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To combine all files with the .txt extension, and then to combine all
files with the .ref extension into one file named
\f[I]Combined.doc\f[R], type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
copy *.txt + *.ref Combined.doc
\f[R]
.fi
