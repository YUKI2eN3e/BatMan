The \f[B]popd\f[R] command changes the current directory to the
directory that was most recently stored by the \f[B]pushd\f[R] command.
.PP
Every time you use the \f[B]pushd\f[R] command, a single directory is
stored for your use.
However, you can store multiple directories by using the \f[B]pushd\f[R]
command multiple times.
The directories are stored sequentially in a virtual stack, so if you
use the \f[B]pushd\f[R] command once, the directory in which you use the
command is placed at the bottom of the stack.
If you use the command again, the second directory is placed on top of
the first one.
The process repeats every time you use the \f[B]pushd\f[R] command.
.PP
If you use the \f[B]popd\f[R] command, the directory on the top of the
stack is removed and the current directory is changed to that directory.
If you use the \f[B]popd\f[R] command again, the next directory on the
stack is removed.
If command extensions are enabled, the \f[B]popd\f[R] command removes
any drive-letter assignments created by the \f[B]pushd\f[R] command.
