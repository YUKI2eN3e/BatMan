.SS Remarks
.IP \[bu] 2
If you don\[cq]t use \f[B]/i\f[R], this command searches for exactly
what you specify for \f[I]string\f[R].
For example, this command treats the characters \f[C]a\f[R] and
\f[C]A\f[R] differently.
If you use \f[B]/i\f[R], however, the search becomes case insensitive,
and it treats \f[C]a\f[R] and \f[C]A\f[R] as the same character.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the string you want to search for contains quotation marks, you must
use double quotation marks for each quotation mark contained within the
string (for example, \[lq]\[lq]\[lq]This string contains quotation
marks\[rq]\[lq]\[lq]).
.IP \[bu] 2
If you omit a file name, this command acts as a filter, taking input
from the standard input source (usually the keyboard, a pipe (|), or a
redirected file) and then displays any lines that contain
\f[I]string\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
To exit the console search use \f[C]CTRL-X\f[R] or \f[C]CTRL-z\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
You can type parameters and command-line options for the \f[B]find\f[R]
command in any order.
.IP \[bu] 2
You can\[cq]t use wildcards (\f[B]*\f[R] and \f[B]?\f[R]) in the
searched string.
To search for a string with wild cards and regex patterns, you can use
the \f[B]FINDSTR\f[R] command.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you use \f[B]/c\f[R] and \f[B]/v\f[R] in the same command line, this
command displays a count of the lines that don\[cq]t contain the
specified string.
If you specify \f[B]/c\f[R] and \f[B]/n\f[R] in the same command line,
\f[B]find\f[R] ignores \f[B]/n\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
This command doesn\[cq]t recognize carriage returns.
When you use this command to search for text in a file that includes
carriage returns, you must limit the search string to text that can be
found between carriage returns (that is, a string that is not likely to
be interrupted by a carriage return).
For example, this command doesn\[cq]t report a match for the string tax
file if a carriage return occurs between the words tax and file.
.IP \[bu] 2
The command accepts wildcards for file names.
When searching in file (or files) it will print the file of the
processed file predeceased by ten dashes.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Find\f[R] command cannot read alternate data streams.
For searching in alternate data streams use \f[B]findstr\f[R],
\f[B]more\f[R] or \f[B]for /f\f[R] commands.
.SS Examples
.PP
To display all lines from \f[I]pencil.md\f[R] that contain the string
\f[I]pencil sharpener\f[R], type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
find \[dq]pencil sharpener\[dq] pencil.md
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To find the text, \f[I]\[lq]The scientists labeled their paper for
discussion only.
It is not a final report.\[rq]\f[R] (including the quotes) in the
\f[I]report.txt\f[R] file, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
find \[dq]\[dq]\[dq]The scientists labeled their paper for discussion only. It is not a final report.\[dq]\[dq]\[dq] < report.txt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To search for a set of files, you can use wildcards.
To search the current directory for files that have the extension
\f[I].bat\f[R] and that contain the string \f[I]PROMPT\f[R] ignoring the
case, type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
find /i \[dq]PROMPT\[dq] *.bat
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To find files names in a directory that contain the string
\f[I]CPU\f[R], use the pipe (|) to direct the output of the
\f[I]dir\f[R] command to the find command as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dir c:\[rs]temp /s /b | find \[dq]CPU\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Find all running processes that do NOT contain \f[I]agent\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tasklist | find /v /i \[dq]agent\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Check if a service is running:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sc query  Winmgmt | find \[dq]RUNNING\[dq] >nul 2>&1 && (echo service is started) || (echo service is stopped)
